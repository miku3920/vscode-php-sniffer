## [1.2.3] - 2020-02-11
### Changed
- Move sniff info in diagnostics
- Rework tab-indented diagnostic position fix to **not** use VSCode-configured
  tab spacing (reverts to the behavior before `1.2.1`)
- Set validator to use progress indicator

## [1.2.2] - 2020-02-07
### Fixed
- Fix erroneous diagnostic position with tab indent where column is 1

## [1.2.1] - 2020-02-06

### Fixed

## [1.2.0] - 2020-01-31
### Added
- Add `phpSniffer.autoDetect` setting to auto-discover executables at
  `[workspaceFolder]/vendor/bin` if `phpSniffer.executablesFolder` is unset.
- Add status bar indicator when formatting

### Changed
- Execution of `phpcbf` and `phpcs` will always use the workspace folder for a
  given file (if it is in a workspace)
  - `phpSniffer.standard` and `phpSniffer.executablesFolder` are now evaluated
    per file â€” relative paths are relative to the file's workspace folder.
  - Since there is a current working directory to work with, this change means
    [PHP_CodeSniffer can detect common ruleset config files](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki/Advanced-Usage#using-a-default-configuration-file)
    in a more expected way.
- Respect `<file>` tags in ruleset files
- `phpSniffer.executablesFolder` no longer requires trailing slash
